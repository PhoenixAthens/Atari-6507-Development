LET's TINKER with the good old `ATARI-2600`

> Repository compiling Assembly code written targetting MOS-6507 processor!

This repository so far is based on [`Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600`](https://www.udemy.com/course/programming-games-for-the-atari-2600/) by Gustavo Pezzi. However, my jest for infinite knowledge won't succumb to just 18hrs of learning material, so I have already stacked a few 6502/6507 assembly programming books on my shelf and the teachings from them will be added to this repository over-time.

Each folder has its own dedicated `README` file. I am not big on making notes (anymore), so all I learn and question has been added to these `READMEs`, this way the notes are compiled in a central location and anyone can access them. Checkout each folder to learn more about 6502/6507 Assembly and a lot more. See Ya!
